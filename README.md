The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find an analysis of the World Cup dataset focusing on the year 2014. Several visualizations help to get a better picture of goals scored, average attendees and more. My favorite data visualization is the map I created. It contains all the locations of stadiums in which games had been played.

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored service complaints in NYC and gain insights into the types of complaints and their geographical distribution. The data set used in this analysis contained information about complaint types, locations, and counts.

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 03

In this project, I explored the data set obtained from FSU which contains information of the weather at the Tampa International Airport (TPA). The main goal was to recreate data visualizations generated with the data from 2016. The updated visuals illustrate the data from 2022. Moreover, I explored the relationship of days on the month and average percipitation. 


**Sample data visualization:** 

I included the chart with information about average percipitation depending on the day of the month here:

### Moving Forward

I learned a lot about visualizing data in the course. Moreover, I learned different principles and what data storytelling is. For the future, I want to work on those skills. First, I want to implement the google drive option which I described in project 2. Second, I want to find out why I always run into problems when loading my interactive plots directly from Github. One reason could be the size of the files.
