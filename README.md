## Project 03

In this project, I explored the data set obtained from FSU which contains information of the weather at the Tampa International Airport (TPA). The main goal was to recreate data visualizations generated with the data from 2016. The updated visuals illustrate the data from 2022. Moreover, I explored the relationship of days on the month and average percipitation. 


**Sample data visualization:** 

I included the chart with information about average percipitation depending on the day of the month here:
