# Data Visualization Project 01

## Executive Summary

The purpose of this project was to analyze the World Cup dataset. This project had the goal of showing how I can utilize my knowledge and to create visuals that help to understand statistics of the WC.

### Motivation

My main motivation came from being a big soccer fan and particularly interested in the World Cup 2014. This is due to the fact that Germany won this WC. I wanna explore the data to find out how we can win the next World cup...

### Description of the data

The World Cup data set allows the user to analyze various characteristics of the World Cup. The World Cups dataset show all information about all the World Cups in the history.

### Data Visualizations

To visually represent the findings, several data visualizations were created:

The first bar chart was generated to display the goals scored by away and home teams. Another one was created to show the average attendance per Stadium in Brazil 2014. Furthermore, an overview of games played in each stadium was created. As an add on, I created a spatial map of Brazil showing where all the different stadiums are located.


#### Key Findings:

1. Away vs. Home Team goals: “Soccer has the largest average home advantage across leagues.” (“https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/home-field-advantage-facts-and-fiction#:~:text=Soccer%20has%20the%20largest%20average,are%20won%20by%20home%20teams.”) To investigate this quote, I looked at home and away goals. We can see, that home teams score more goals on average. Besides that, there is no real advantage of being a home team in a World Cup. All games are played on “neutral ground”. The only team that had an home advantage was the Brazilian Team.



2. Average attendees per stadium: The attendees of a football game create a unique environment that can have a big impact on the game. On average a Bundesliga Stadium has 43,000 viewers every game. The highest number of attendees ever were counted in Glasgow. 1937 almost 150,000 people watched the Game Scotland against England. In our bar chart, the Estadio de Maracana is the one with most attendees. The capacity of the stadium is 76,935.

3. Spatial map - Stadium locations: It can also be beneficial to play in the same stadium for more than one time. This is due to travel effort or existing routines. If we take a look at the map of all stadiums, the travel effort can be very high going from stadium to stadium. This can influence the regenaration and practice schedules of teams.
